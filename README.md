# PongGame

[Deployed Game](https://ehcarr.github.io/PongGame/)

overview:
This is a simple Pong Game, which was completed during the first phase of my General Assembly Bootcamp. I Made this game using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.  The user controls his pong paddle (left side paddle) by moving their mouse up down on the black board where the paddles and the balls are located. They play against a computer (right side paddle).The user should  hit the ball back to the other side without it touching your side of the board. The user scores a point each time the ball hits the board wall on the computer's side and vice versa.
